Face and Eye Detection using HAAR-Cascade Classifier

Face and eye detection are fundamental tasks in computer vision, with applications ranging from security systems to human-computer interaction. The HAAR Cascade classifier, an object detection algorithm proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones, is widely used for these purposes. This project aims to detect faces and eyes in images and video streams using the HAAR Cascade classifier.

Objectives
To detect faces in images and video streams.
To detect eyes within the detected faces.
To provide real-time face and eye detection in a video feed.
